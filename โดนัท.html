            <h2>Warning: Eating too many donuts can be bad for your health.</h2>
            <p>A donut is a type of deep fried dough confectionery or dessert food. The doughnut is popular in many countries and prepared in various forms as a sweet snack that can be homemade or purchased in bakeries, supermarkets, food stalls, and franchised specialty outlets.</p>
            <h3>Did you know? Donut can also be spelled "doughnut."</h3>
            <p>The two most common types are the <strong>toroidal ring doughnut</strong> and the <strong>filled doughnut</strong>—which is injected with fruit preserves, cream, custard, or other sweet fillings. A small spherical piece of dough may be cooked as a doughnut hole. Other shapes include rings, balls, and flattened spheres, as well as ear shapes, twists and other forms. Doughnut varieties are also divided into cake and risen type doughnuts.</p>
